# FAS-HCS

This cotains the pipelines and data processing used for analyzing data from the Fluorecent actin stainging high-content (FAS-HCS) assay.

The assay was originally described by Stuart Knutton et al in 1989. The authors show that so called attaching and effacecing lesions caused by various pathogens can be visualized with flourecent phallotoxins. At that time it had been established that these pathogens lesion the brush boder microvillous membrane, and that they also do it in human tissue culture cell lines. Electron microscopy demonstrated dense concentrations of microfilaments present in the apical cytoplasm beneath the attached bacteria. Using fluorecein conjugated to phatllotoxins - toxins that strongly bind to actin filaments, the authors demonstrated that the lesions are rich in cytoskeletal actin and demonstrated a new way to visualize the phenotype.
